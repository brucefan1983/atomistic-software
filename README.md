# atsim-trends

This is a collaboratively edited list of atomistic simulation codes, together with citation information of the past couple of years.


Please visit ... for the live web site.


## Adding a simulation engine

Anybody is welcome to contribute simulation engines.

In order to keep the size of the list somewhat manageable, a new code must have had **at least one year with 100 citations or more**.

 * Add entry to `src/data/codes.json`
 * Add citation information to `src/data/citations.json`

## Developing the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
