# atsim-trends

This is a collaboratively edited list of atomistic simulation codes, together with citation information of the past couple of years.

Please visit [ltalirz.github.io/atsim-trends](https://ltalirz.github.io/atsim-trends/#/) for the live web site.

## Adding a simulation engine

Anybody is welcome to contribute simulation engines.

In order to keep the size of the list somewhat manageable, a new code must have had **at least one year with 100 citations or more**.

 * Add code metadata to [`src/data/codes.json`](src/data/codes.json)
 * Add citation information to [`src/data/citations.json`](src/data/citations.json)

## Developing the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the ["Major codes in electronic-structure theory, quantum chemistry, and molecular-dynamics"](https://www.nomad-coe.eu/old-pages/externals/codes) collection maintained by the [NOMAD Center of Excellence](https://www.nomad-coe.eu) from 2017-2019.
Thanks go to Luca Ghiringelli for being supportive of this effort to transform the static list into an interactive app and a collaborative project.
